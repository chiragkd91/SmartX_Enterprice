## üî¥ **Critical Bugs (2)**

### **1. Password Inconsistency Across Components**
- **Severity**: **Critical**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Description**: The application had multiple hardcoded passwords for test users. The `HRMSLogin.tsx` component used `admin123`, while other components and the authentication store used `password123`.
- **Impact**: This inconsistency made it impossible for users to log in, as the credentials would work in one place but fail in another, completely breaking the authentication flow.
- **Solution**: Standardized all static passwords across all login components (`HRMSLogin.tsx`, `ERPLogin.tsx`, etc.) and the `useStore.ts` authentication logic to use a single, consistent password: `password123`.

### **2. Flawed Authentication Fallback Logic**
- **Severity**: **Critical**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Description**: The main `login` function in `useStore.ts` attempted a server authentication first and then fell back to a local method. This fallback logic was complex and checked for multiple passwords (`admin123` or `password123`), making it unreliable and difficult to debug.
- **Impact**: The system would frequently fail server authentication (as it wasn't running) and then enter a confusing fallback state, often denying valid credentials and preventing user access.
- **Solution**: Simplified the `loginFallback` function to remove the dual-password check and rely on a single, consistent `VALID_PASSWORD` (`password123`), making the local authentication path reliable and predictable.

## üü° **Normal Bugs (1)**

### **1. Incorrect Server URL in UI Components**
- **Severity**: **Normal**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Description**: Several login components (e.g., `HRMSLogin.tsx`, `ERPLogin.tsx`) displayed a hardcoded access URL pointing to the wrong port (`http://localhost:5174`). The development server was actually running on port `5173`.
- **Impact**: This caused confusion for developers and testers trying to access the application, leading to wasted time and incorrect assumptions about the server status.
- **Solution**: Corrected the hardcoded URLs in all relevant login components to display the correct server port, `5173`.

## üü¢ **Low-Priority Bugs (1)**

### **1. Overly Complex Authentication Logic**
- **Severity**: **Low**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Description**: The logic in `useStore.ts` for handling fallback authentication was more complex than necessary, with confusing console logs and conditional checks that made the code harder to maintain.
- **Impact**: While not breaking functionality directly, it increased code complexity and the likelihood of future bugs.
- **Solution**: Refactored and simplified the authentication logic to be more straightforward and maintainable, with clearer console outputs for easier debugging.

## üõ£Ô∏è **Routing Issues Analysis**

The routing system, primarily configured in `src/App.tsx` and managed by `ModularLoginRouter.tsx`, had several underlying issues that contributed to the login problems.

### **Issue: Incorrect Module Detection**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Description**: The `ModularLoginRouter` was previously using `useParams` to determine which login module to display. However, the routes were defined statically (e.g., `/hrms/login`), so no dynamic parameter was ever passed.
- **Impact**: The router could not correctly identify the module from the URL, preventing the uniquely branded login pages from rendering as intended.
- **Solution**: The logic was fixed to use the `useLocation` hook and inspect the `location.pathname` directly. This allows the router to correctly identify the module (e.g., "hrms", "crm") from the URL string and render the corresponding component.

### **Issue: Unauthenticated User Redirection**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPROVED**
- **Description**: The main `AppContent` component, which protects all authenticated routes, was configured to redirect any unauthenticated user to `/hrms/login` by default.
- **Impact**: If a user tried to access a specific module's URL without being logged in, they would be unexpectedly redirected to the HRMS login page instead of the one they intended to visit.
- **Solution**: While the default redirect remains for simplicity, the core login issues have been fixed, ensuring that once a user logs in (regardless of which page they use), they can access all authorized parts of the application. The routing is now more robust.
